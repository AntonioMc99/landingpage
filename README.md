# landingpage     This project is my attempt to build the Blogr website design from Frontend Mentor using Bootstrap. I’m still learning Bootstrap, and I found some parts a bit confusing, especially with how to use the grid and components properly. I tried my best to make the site look like the design and be responsive on different screen sizes. I plan to communicate with my team and instructors about the areas I’m struggling with so I can improve and get better at using Bootstrap. For now, the site includes a navbar, some content sections, and buttons styled with Bootstrap classes, along with some custom CSS to help with the look. I hope to keep practicing and refining this project as I learn more.
